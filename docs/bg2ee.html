  <li>Dorn's first  talk with the PC is supposed to be one of three, depending on your reputation and whether you known him from the events in BG.

  <li>Launchers that generate their own ammo (e.g. Gesen's Bow or the Firetooth crossbow) would override the projectile of loaded ammo, meaning it could interact with the target protections incorrectly.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (bow15.itm, <span data-code-marker="+">bow19.itm</span>, <span data-code-marker="+">compb15.itm</span>, <span data-code-marker="+">compb19.itm</span>, <span data-code-marker="+">slng07.itm</span>, <span data-code-marker="+">wasling.itm</span>, <span data-code-marker="+">xbow15.itm</span>, <span data-code-marker="+">xbow16.itm</span>)</span></li>

<h3><a name="hold_revamp" id="hold_revamp"></a>Revamp of Hold, Paralysis, and Web <a href="#hold_revamp"><img src="https://content.invisioncic.com/u284679/monthly_2022_11/link.png.a311bee5fc8e33e5450e13e9586b2372.png" alt="Link to this section" width="14" height="9" /></a></h3>
<p>In the original Baldur's Gate, there were four internal methods to make an NPC freeze: paralysis (used in undead melee attacks), web (used by the spell of the same name and spiders), and two forms of hold (one for Hold spells and a second, special one reserved for special cases like cutscenes). As the series progressed through the BG expansion, into BG2, and concluding with Throne of Bhaal, these were used more and more freely, and muddled--you had web spells using paralysis, abilities that blocked the special hold (which nothing should) to the point where there was little distinction, if any, between these effects from a player's point of view. EEFP is re-establishing the scheme, going all the way back to the original Baldur's Gate, of trying to use these effects in a way that 
  differentiates them and fixes a number of bugs along the way. Paralysis is, once again, the domain of undead attacks, and from which elves have some protection. Web is no longer paired by default with paralysis, meaning items which protect you from web no longer provide paralysis protection by accident, and the special hold will now always take effect. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(amul17.itm, antiweb.itm, ax1h10.itm, bhaalhp1.itm, bhaalimm.itm, blun12.itm, blun25.itm, chalcy3.itm, deva.itm, dragring.itm, dwfpdeva.spl, dwfpdgcn.spl, dwfpdgfb.spl, dwfpohdv.spl, dwfpsmsl.spl, dwfpsmst.spl, dwfpwwfs.spl, dwfpwwhs.spl, enginest.2da, ghoul1.itm, ghoult.itm, gorfirg.itm, gorjelgr.itm, gormisti.itm, hamm10.itm, hamm11.itm, immchs.itm, imoenhp1.itm, insanity.spl, ipsion.itm, jwsuper.itm, kuobolt3.itm, mage05.itm, magiweb.itm, mel01.itm, minhp1.itm, objring.itm, ohbbanno.spl, ohbdeva.itm, ohdmhp1.itm, ohhexam4.itm, ohnwand1.spl, ohrrage.spl, ohsmode1.spl, ohsmode4.spl, ring94.itm, ring95.itm, ring97.itm, ring98.itm, ring99.itm, ringkora.itm, rossring.itm, sengua04.itm, spcl152.spl, spcl233b.spl, spcl242.spl, spcl321.spl, spcl742.spl, spdr201.spl, spermel.itm, spin117.spl, spin566.spl, spin648.spl, spin683.spl, spin872.spl, spin906.spl, spin988.spl, sppr208.spl, sppr305.spl, sppr508.spl, sppr728.spl, sppr989.spl, spwi215.spl, spwi306.spl, spwi324.spl, spwi507.spl, spwi818.spl, spwi818a.spl, spwi918.spl, spwi918a.spl, spwm122.spl, stalker.itm, trollimm.itm, vampreg.itm, vampreg1.itm, vampreg2.itm, wand12.itm, wand14.itm)</span></p>

<p>In the original Baldur's Gate II engine, something that made you 'immune to X' was actually fairly limited: you could make the character directly immune to the effect and (typically) the normal portrait icon, but many of the ancillary effects (sound effects, visuals, etc.) were hit or miss. A party member under free action would resist being paralyzed by a ghast, but the sound effect that plays when the paralysis was supposed to expire would still play. Similarly, creatures immune to confusion would resist the confusion itself but still play a spinning animation over their head for the spell's intended duration. Thankfully, the EEs provide more tools for dealing with immunities, and we can  block all of these subsidiary effects. A parallel issue occurred when removing or curing effects. If you used Remove Fear on a panicking creature, the spinning animation over their head didn't always go away or the expiration sound would still play. Using a new EE feature, these subsidiary effects can be removed when the main effect is removed. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(#cureber.spl, #curebld.spl, #curecon.spl, #curedef.spl, #curedis.spl,

  <p>This is a roundup of fixes that primarily impact modders and are not visible to players. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Neothelid lacked an ini file and correct animate/anisnd.ids entries. (3001.ini, animate.ids, anisnd.ids)</li>
    <li>Several of the splprot.2da entries (specifically, alignment checks) were mislabeled. (splprot.2da)</li>
    <li>Kit ability tables for the archer, dark moon monk, and sun soul monk had missing entries for some columns. (clabmo02.2da, clabmo03.2da, clabrn02.2da)</li>
    <li>Various spells use feedback (op139) with non-permanent timing or non-zero durations. (helm32.itm, spin595.spl, spin878.spl, spin893.spl, spin929.spl, spin931.spl, spwi714.spl, spwi815.spl, spwi958.spl)</li>
    <li>Misindexed items and spells were fixed. (hamm06.itm, ohbwi302.spl, ohbwi304.spl, staf01.itm)</li>
    <li>Detect Evil no longer gets routed through a subspell. On the originals, only evil creatures got checked for magic resistance, which let you know that any 'magic resistance' creature was evil. On the EEs, everyone gets checked which means this is no longer a free check. (spcl212.spl, spin120.spl, sppr101.spl, spwi202.spl)</li>
    <li>Sleep icons are folded into op39 directly on various sleep effects (spin940.spl, spwi004.spl, spwi213.spl, spwi411.spl, spwm187.spl) </li>
    <li>'Bypass mirror image' flags were set on a number of opcodes that don't support it (spin940.spl, spwi004.spl, spwi213.spl, spwm187.spl) </li>
    <li>Spells which use improved invisibility will no longer set normal invisibility as it's redundant (ohbwi405.spl, spdr401.spl, spin544.spl, spin698.spl, spwi405.spl, spwi505.spl) </li>
    <li>Removed duplicate and/or redundant effects from many items and spells (amul17.itm, bdddoorx.spl, bdsha01c.spl, bdsha06b.spl, bdspirim.itm, bdspnaim.itm, bhaalhp1.itm, bhaalimm.itm, blun30.itm, chalcy3.itm, clck04.itm, clck27.itm, dgarchon.spl, dragring.itm, gorchr.itm, gorfirg.itm, gorjelfu.itm, gorjelgr.itm, gormisti.itm, imoenhp1.itm, ipsion.itm, jwsuper.itm, lichtel.spl, mel01.itm, minhp1.itm, misc9y.itm, ohbbanno.spl, ohbdrkrg.itm, ohbjoke2.spl, ohdmhp1.itm, ohrboot1.itm, ohrfear.spl, ohtmps2d.spl, ohtmps2e.spl, potn23.itm, potn25.itm, potn32.itm, potn40.itm, potn45.itm, potn46.itm, ring09.itm, ring95.itm, rodsword.itm, rossring.itm, scrl10.itm, scrl11.itm, scrl12.itm, scrl13.itm, scrl18.itm, scrlpet.itm, sengua04.itm, shld24.itm, shld24a.itm, spcl152.spl, spcl321.spl, spcl611.spl, spcl612.spl, spcl613.spl, spcl632.spl, spcl633.spl, spcl634.spl, spcl643.spl, spcl644.spl, spcl722.spl, spcl900.spl, spcl901.spl, spdr301.spl, sper12.itm, spin107.spl, spin110.spl, spin111.spl, spin117.spl, spin121.spl, spin122.spl, spin123.spl, spin124.spl, spin125.spl, spin126.spl, spin127.spl, spin150.spl, spin151.spl, spin152.spl, spin153.spl, spin154.spl, spin155.spl, spin156.spl, spin157.spl, spin529.spl, spin632.spl, spin667.spl, spin710.spl, spin714.spl, spin717.spl, spin718.spl, spin718a.spl, spin783.spl, spin823.spl, spin852.spl, spin920.spl, spin952.spl, spinhum.spl, sppr111.spl, sppr319.spl, sppr508.spl, sppr517.spl, sppr613.spl, sppr701.spl, sppr704.spl, sppr717.spl, sppr717a.spl, sppr731.spl, sppr732.spl, spra302.spl, spra303.spl, sprngb03.itm, sprngb04.itm, sprngl03.itm, sprngl04.itm, sprngs01.itm, sprngs02.itm, sprngs03.itm, sprngs04.itm, sprngz05.itm, spwi002.spl, spwi222.spl, spwi308.spl, spwi311.spl, spwi318.spl, spwi415.spl, spwi489.spl, spwi490.spl, spwi491.spl, spwi493.spl, spwi494.spl, spwi495.spl, spwi496.spl, spwi497.spl, spwi498.spl, spwi499.spl, spwi511.spl, spwi522.spl, spwi618.spl, spwi701.spl, spwi705.spl, spwi711.spl, spwi723.spl, spwi902.spl, spwi997.spl, surehp1.itm, sw1h27.itm, sw2h21.itm, trollimm.itm, tstatue.itm, wand09.itm, wand19.itm)</li>
    <li>Effects with permanent timing shouldn't have durations (sppr202.spl)</li>
    <li>Various spells and items had to have effects reorganized to facilitate other fixes (ax1h10.itm, blun12.itm, blun25.itm, deva.itm, dwfpdeva.spl, dwfpdgcn.spl, dwfpdgfb.spl, dwfpohdv.spl, dwfpsmsl.spl, dwfpsmst.spl, dwfpwwfs.spl, dwfpwwhs.spl, hamm10.itm, hamm11.itm, insanity.spl, ohbdeva.itm, spermel.itm, wand12.itm)</li>
    <li>Several spells that used swarms of EFFs have been recoded with cleaner  implementations  (sppr707.spl, sppr707a.spl, sppr707b.spl, sppr707c.spl, sppr710.spl, sppr715.spl) </li>
    <li>Targeting for bhaal1a.spl was incorrect (bhaal1a.spl)</li>
    <li>The duplicate, unused, and misspelled EigthNearestEnemyOfType and EigthNearestMyGroupOfType objects are removed. (object.ids)</li>
    <li> Kit check in splprot.2da is useless since it's a bitwise check, which only works for kits (e.g. mages) which happen to be  powers-of-two. It's changed to be a straight numerical check. (splprot.2da) </li>
