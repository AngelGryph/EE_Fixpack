Feel free to add/adjust the documentation as needed. The class <span class="bg2fp_beta">bg2fp_beta (red)</span> should be used to mark fixes that are in the Beta Core Fixes (nothing yet) and the <span class="bg2fp_modder">bg2fp_modder (magenta)</span> class should be used for modder notes. In the live pages, these are normally colored, but hidden, unless the user enables them. </p>

<p> Textual changes were made to correct errors or reflect other changes. Note that this is limited to material or factual errors; spelling, grammar, or other typos are handled by the Game Text Update. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The description for Carrion Summons indicated that it would summon &quot;1d2&quot; carrion crawlers, but it's not a 50-50 chance. The spell has a 65% chance to summon two, and as such the language has been generalized. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #26586)</span></li>
  <li>The Sun Soulbeam ability did not roll for an attack, it just hits, contrary to its description.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (strrefs #31984, #32224)</span></li>
  <li>The ranger Charm Animal ability does not mention its duration. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #32228)</span></li>
  <li>Several of the  shapeshifting abilities and spells did not list all of their abilities; generally it was missing the weapon enchantment of their natural weapons. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strrefs  #32246, #32247, #32262, #32263, #32264, #32265, #32266, #32267, #32329, #32889)</span></li>
  <li>The listed weight of Paralytic Bolt +1 was wrong. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #52365)</span></li>
  <li>Corrected  family names for Ajantis <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #46138)</span></li>

<ul>
  <li>The non-proficiency penalty for Shadowdancers and Mage-Thieves were incorrect. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(clswpbon.2da)</span></li>
  <li>Wing buffet/knockback effects were not being applied to all creatures who should be affected. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(cdwb220.eff, cdwb225.eff, cdwb230.eff, cdwb3100.eff, cdwb470.eff, spin547.spl, spin658.spl, spin695.spl, spin854.spl, spin896.spl, spwi818.spl, spwi918.spl, spyanc01.spl)</span></li>
  <li>Items with poison effects  block their own effects on a poison-immune target.

  <li>The slow caused by an otyugh hit was a disease effect, but was not being alleviated by various disease cures. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bddraggh.itm, bdotyg01.itm, bdotyg02.itm, otyugh.itm, pudden01.itm)</span></li>
  <li>If SoD is not installed, three spells from SoD are added to the game even though they're not made available.

<ul>
  <li>Several generic Beregost commoner dialogues were supposed to comment on the death of Basillus, but the check for his death was incorrect. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ftowbe.dlg, mtowbe.dlg, mtowbez.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>One of the Beregost commoners who threatens to call her Flaming Fist husband was checking the wrong variable to see if he was dead. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ftowbe.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>Tiax would have a No Valid Links Or Replies error if you spoke to him while he was charmed. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(tiax.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>Glanma and Oberan would have nothing to say on repeat visits. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(glanma.dlg, oberan.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>Perdue said he's giving you 50 gold in his dialogue, but only delivered if you had accepted the quest prior to returning his sword. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(perdue.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>If Silke survives until chapter seven, she spoke with you as if she was at the coronation in Baldur's Gate. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(silke.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>You could have told the spirit in the bugbear cave to kill the bugbears even if they were already slain. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdshadow.bcs, bdshadow.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>Some of the dialogue triggers for comments in the blind albino cave were a bit loose and could fire elsewhere. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bd5100aw.bcs, bddynahj.dlg, bdjaheij.dlg, bdminscj.dlg, bdmkhiij.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>Some NPCs have comments in Korlasz' Tomb, but on lower difficulties the threshold for them to comment was too high as too many enemies would despawn. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bd0120.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>In the Lich Outpost, Neera's comment was checking the wrong state of the skull. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bd2000.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>An SoD Minsc-Rasaad banter was not properly checking for Rasaad, missing the banter. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdminsc.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>At the beginning of SoD, you can tell NPC to 'go back to the crypt entrance' when kicking them out, but it didn't actually make them do anything. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdparty.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>Many NPCs had charmed dialogues but you could never see them because they were misweighted. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(alyth.dlg, amnis2.dlg, amnis4.dlg, bandct.dlg, bandic.dlg, beggba.dlg,   bentan.dlg, boyba2.dlg, boyba3.dlg, boybe1.dlg, boybe2.dlg, brevli.dlg,   dabron.dlg, druidc.dlg, farm2.dlg, farm5.dlg, farmbe.dlg, fcook2.dlg,   fcook3.dlg, flam2.dlg, flam5.dlg, flam7.dlg, flam7.dlg, flam8.dlg,   flam9.dlg, friend.dlg, friwen.dlg, ftowba.dlg, ftowbe.dlg, ftowfr.dlg,   ftowna.dlg, gantol.dlg, girba1.dlg, girba2.dlg, girba3.dlg, greywo.dlg,   haffg2.dlg, halffg.dlg, halfg2.dlg, halfg3.dlg, halfg4.dlg, halfg6.dlg,   hobgo5.dlg, housg1.dlg, housg4.dlg, housg6.dlg, iron11.dlg, iron12.dlg,   iron14.dlg, iron2.dlg, iron3.dlg, iron4.dlg, iron5.dlg, iron6.dlg,   ironm4.dlg, kivanp.dlg, mcook2.dlg, mcook5.dlg, minern.dlg, minern.dlg,   minern.dlg, monken.dlg, mtbe3.dlg, mtbe4.dlg, mtbe5.dlg, mtbe7.dlg,   mtbe8.dlg, mtbe9.dlg, mtob2.dlg, mtob3.dlg, mtob4.dlg, mtob5.dlg,   mtowf2.dlg, nemagreb.dlg, nobl10.dlg, nobl11.dlg, nobl12.dlg,   nobl14.dlg, nobl2.dlg, nobl3.dlg, nobl5.dlg, nobl6.dlg, nobl7.dlg,   nobl8.dlg, nobw2.dlg, nobw5.dlg, nobw6.dlg, nobw9.dlg, perdue.dlg,   poghm7.dlg, prost3.dlg, prost5.dlg, prost7.dlg, prost8.dlg, pumberl.dlg,   read3.dlg, rielta.dlg, servan.dlg, serwen.dlg, sil.dlg, smith.dlg,   tiaxp.dlg, trave2.dlg, travel.dlg, viconi.dlg, viconp.dlg, xanp.dlg,   yeslic.dlg)</span></li>

  <li>Mnay NPCs had 'nothing to say to you' due to how the EE engine handles dialogue vs. the original engine.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (boyba2.dlg, boybe1.dlg, boybe2.dlg, brilla.dlg, dillar.dlg, farm3.dlg,   fcook2.dlg, fcook3.dlg, flam10.dlg, flam2.dlg, flam7.dlg, flam8.dlg,   flam9.dlg, flambg.dlg, flamgg.dlg, ftobe7.dlg, ftowb4.dlg, ftowb6.dlg,   ftowb7.dlg, girba1.dlg, haffg2.dlg, halfg5.dlg, housg1.dlg, housg2.dlg,   housg3.dlg, housg4.dlg, hunter.dlg, iron3.dlg, ironm3.dlg, ironm4.dlg,   jhasso.dlg, mtbe10.dlg, mtbe11.dlg, mtbe2.dlg, mtbe3.dlg, mtbe4.dlg,   mtbe8.dlg, mtob3.dlg, mtob4.dlg, mtob5.dlg, mtob7.dlg, mtob8.dlg,   mtob9.dlg, mtown2.dlg, nobl12.dlg, nobw3.dlg, nobw5.dlg, nobw9.dlg,   poe.dlg, prost7.dlg, prost8.dlg, rededg.dlg, serva2.dlg, serwen.dlg,   trave2.dlg, volose.dlg)</span></li>
  <li> Zelma (<abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear"><abbr title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr></abbr>)   can be charmed to get your money back. In the gap between getting it   back and the charm wearing off, she had nothing to say.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (bdzelma.dlg) </span></li>
  <li> Be'land's charmed dialogue says you can enjoy the museum for free, but   was not setting the variable to stop him from soliciting the entrance   fee once the charm expired <span class="bg2fp_modder">(beland.dlg) </span></li>
  <li> Multiple charmed dialogues could re-open journal entries for completed   quests: Brandilar - Investigating the Merchants' League Estate   <span class="bg2fp_modder">(brandi.dlg)</span>, Flaming Fist Enforcer - Afoul of the Law<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (ffhunt.dlg)</span>,   Harbor Master - Investigating the Iron Throne<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (harbor.dlg)</span>, two Beregost   commoners - The Wizard's School<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (mtbe2.dlg, mtbe6.dlg) </span></li>
  <li> Delainy/Durlyle have two dialogues, one for their appearance in the   village and a second one if they help you escape. The first one had a   charmed dialogue that would reveal the secret of the village too early   and has been disabled. The same charmed dialogue is still available in   their second appearance where it's appropriate.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (delainy1.dlg,   durlyle1.dlg) </span></li>
  <li> The Flaming Fist Enforcer hassling the party south of Beregost has two   flunkies. If he peacefully leaves, they should leave with him.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (flam5.dlg) </span></li>
  <li> One of the commoners in Beregost (ar3316) calls the guards, but no guards were actually appearing.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (ftobe4.dlg) </span></li>
  <li> Several charmed dialogues have the charmed <abbr title="Non-Player Character"><abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr></abbr> giving the party something. In most of them, they would check to make   sure they had the item in question first, but two were missed.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (ftobe5.dlg, nobl8.dlg) </span></li>
  <li> A few dialogues would blindly hand off dialogue to another <abbr title="Non-Player Character"><abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr></abbr> nearby without bothering to check if that <abbr title="Non-Player Character"><abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr></abbr> was actually available for dialogue, e.g. Marl and Dunkin, Helshara and   Ithmeera, and others. This would cause the dialogue to exit abruptly on   a 'Continue' button. Appropriate checks have been added, and the   dialogue now cleanly exits.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (helsha.dlg, ithmee.dlg, housg1.dlg,   marl.bcs, marl.dlg, mtown2.dlg, nobl4.dlg) </span></li>
  <li> If Hentold gives the party his dagger while charmed, his normal   dialogue would assume he still had it and he'd continue to try and give   it to you. These dialogues now check if he has the dagger first.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (hentol.dlg) </span></li>
  <li> One of the shared dialogues for Nashkel commoners has 13 random   replies. However, one of them is closed when the Brage quest ends,   giving a 1/13 chance of 'X has nothing to say'. One of the other 12   lines will now appear under this circumstance. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(mtowna.dlg) </span></li>
  <li> The six diggers at the archaeological site all share one common   dialogue, and have the 'X has nothing to say' bug. This couldn't be   fixed the conventional way (grabbing common selection sounds) because   they have different soundsets. In addition, they have five lines that   play in sequence based off of NTTT triggers. This means that if you   speak to each miner, you'll get the same line six times and will only   see the other lines if you speak to one of them five times. To address   both if these, these five lines are weighted randomly so that they'll   always have something to say, and to make it substantially less obvious   that they're using the same dialogue.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (digger.dlg) </span></li>
  <li> Several commoners in <abbr title="Baldur's Gate"><abbr title="Baldur's Gate">BG</abbr></abbr> use a shared dialogue; prior to chapter seven there are nine possible   lines. Once chapter seven hits, they change to three, but they all have   the same trigger so only one could play. Based on other commoner   dialogues and the lines themselves, it looks like these three lines   should depend on the party reputation, and the appropriate triggers have   been added. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ftowba.dlg) </span></li>
  <li> The shared, generic Nashkel miner dialogues had two lines for the   miners outside before you speak to Emerson, but they were weighted so   low you could never see them <span class="bg2fp_modder">(minern.dlg) </span></li>

  <li>BGEE changed how NPCs join, so that the player could choose weapon proficiencies, thieving abilities, and the like.

<p>There were several ways that polymorphing--whether via a spell like Shapechange, a druid's natural abilities, or from an item like Cloak of the Wolf--could introduce numerous issues, especially when shifting directly between forms. A creature could retain stats or abilities from a previous form, or forced/voluntary/timed shapheshifts could overrun one another. As such, these abilities went through a complete overhaul designed to streamline the process, cover edge cases, and minimize issues. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdsw1h26.spl, bolt05.itm, brblp.itm, brbrp.itm, brbrp1.itm, brbrp2.itm, cdgoliro.itm, cdmindfl.itm, cdwolfm.itm, clck04.itm, clck04.spl, earthrn.itm, firern.itm, plybear1.itm, plybear2.itm, plyflind.itm, plyjelly.itm, plymstar.itm, plysala.itm, plyspid.itm, plyspid2.itm, plywolf1.itm, plywyvrn.itm, spcl611.spl, spcl612.spl, spcl613.spl, spcl632.spl, spcl633.spl, spcl634.spl, spcl643.spl, spcl644.spl, spcl731.spl, spdm103.spl,  spin107.spl, spin110.spl, spin111.spl, spin113.spl, spin122.spl, spin123.spl, spin124.spl, spin125.spl, spin126.spl, spin127.spl, spin150.spl, spin150r.eff, spin151.spl, spin152.spl, spin153.spl, spin154.spl, spin155.spl, spin156.spl, spin157.spl, spin160.spl, spin663.spl, spin717.spl, spin717a.spl, spin783.spl, spin783a.spl, spin822.spl, spin823.spl, spin823a.spl, spin852.spl, spin852a.spl, spin868.spl, spin869.spl, spin974.spl, spinhum.spl, spinhumr.spl, spinhums.eff, spinhums.spl, spinhumw.eff, spinhumw.spl, splprot.2da, splstate.ids, sppr110.spl, sppr206.spl, sppr213.spl, sppr414.spl, sppr510.spl, sppr511.spl, sppr608.spl, sppr614.spl, sppr721.spl, spwi115.spl, spwi117.spl, spwi218.spl, spwi325.spl, spwi415.spl, spwi416.spl, spwi489.spl, spwi489r.eff, spwi490.spl, spwi491.spl, spwi493.spl, spwi494.spl, spwi495.spl, spwi496.spl, spwi497.spl, spwi498.spl, spwi499.spl, spwi518.spl, spwi711.spl, spwi711a.spl, spwi915.spl, spwi916.spl, spwi920.spl, spwi952.spl, spwm113.spl, spwm113a.spl, spwm183.spl, squirp.itm, trollall.itm, wand09.itm, wolfchar.cre, wolfgr.itm, wolfm.itm, wswolf.itm)</span></p>

<p>In the original Baldur's Gate, there were four internal methods to make an NPC freeze: paralysis (used in undead melee attacks), web (used by the spell of the same name and spiders), and two forms of hold (one for Hold spells and a second, special one reserved for special cases like cutscenes). As the series progressed through the BG expansion, into BG2, and concluding with Throne of Bhaal, these were used more and more freely, and muddled--you had web spells using paralysis, abilities that blocked the special hold (which nothing should) to the point where there was little distinction, if any, between these effects from a player's point of view. EEFP is re-establishing the scheme, going all the way back to the original Baldur's Gate, of trying to use these effects in a way that 
  differentiates them and fixes a number of bugs along the way. Paralysis is, once again, the domain of undead attacks, and from which elves have some protection. Web is no longer paired by default with paralysis, meaning items which protect you from web no longer provide paralysis protection by accident, and the special hold will now always take effect. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(amul17.itm, antiweb.itm, bhaalhp1.itm, bhaalimm.itm, chalcy3.itm, dragring.itm, dwfpsirf.spl, enginest.2da, ghoul1.itm, ghoult.itm, immchs.itm, imoenhp1.itm, ipsion.itm, jwsuper.itm, mage05.itm, magiweb.itm, minhp1.itm, ohsmode1.spl, ohsmode4.spl, ring94.itm, ring95.itm, ring97.itm, ring98.itm, ring99.itm, ringkora.itm, sengua04.itm, sirine1.itm, spcl152.spl, spcl233b.spl, spcl242.spl, spcl321.spl, spcl742.spl, spdr201.spl, spin117.spl, spin683.spl, spin872.spl, spin906.spl, spin988.spl, sppr208.spl, sppr305.spl, sppr508.spl, sppr989.spl, spwi215.spl, spwi306.spl, spwi324.spl, spwi507.spl, spwm122.spl, trollimm.itm)</span></p>

<p>In the original Baldur's Gate II engine, something that made you 'immune to X' was actually fairly limited: you could make the character directly immune to the effect and (typically) the normal portrait icon, but many of the ancillary effects (sound effects, visuals, etc.) were hit or miss. A party member under free action would resist being paralyzed by a ghast, but the sound effect that plays when the paralysis was supposed to expire would still play. Similarly, creatures immune to confusion would resist the confusion itself but still play a spinning animation over their head for the spell's intended duration. Thankfully, the EEs provide more tools for dealing with immunities, and we can  block all of these subsidiary effects. A parallel issue occurred when removing or curing effects. If you used Remove Fear on a panicking creature, the spinning animation over their head didn't always go away or the expiration sound would still play. Using a new EE feature, these subsidiary effects can be removed when the main effect is removed. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(#cureber.spl, #curebld.spl, #curecon.spl, #curedef.spl, #curedis.spl,

  <p>This is a roundup of fixes that primarily impact modders and are not visible to players. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Neothelid lacked an ini file and correct animate/anisnd.ids entries. (3001.ini, animate.ids, anisnd.ids)</li>
    <li>Several of the splprot.2da entries (specifically, alignment checks) were mislabeled. (splprot.2da)</li>
    <li>Several entries were added to spell.ids to enable easier scripting. (spell.ids)</li>
    <li>Kit ability tables for the archer, dark moon monk, and sun soul monk had missing entries for some columns. (clabmo02.2da, clabmo03.2da, clabrn02.2da)</li>
    <li>The area script for Coast Way Crossing (SoD version) has an OR(4) block with only two conditions. (bd1000.bcs)</li>
    <li>The first level of the Cloakwood Mines had a bunch of corrupt junk in its rest spawn block, which is cleaned up. (ar1801.are)</li>
    <li>Misindexed items and spells were fixed. (ption41.itm, spin158.spl)</li>
    <li>The unused princess item blocked confusion, but not the confusion visual effect. (princess.itm)</li>
    <li>The expiration sound for the cutscene sleep spell doesn't match the sleep duration. (bdsleep.spl)</li>
    <li>Various spells use feedback (op139) with non-permanent timing or non-zero durations. (bdshriek.spl, spin878.spl, spin893.spl, spin929.spl, spin931.spl, spwi714.spl, spwm178.spl)</li>
    <li>Effects with permanent timing shouldn't have durations (spin672.spl, spin878.spl, spin927.spl, sppr202.spl, spwi303.spl, spwi888.spl)</li>
    <li>Detect Evil no longer gets routed through a subspell. On the originals, only evil creatures got checked for magic resistance, which let you know that any 'magic resistance' creature was evil. On the EEs, everyone gets checked which means this is no longer a free check. (spcl212.spl, spin120.spl, sppr101.spl, spwi202.spl)</li>
    <li>Sleep icons are folded into op39 directly on various sleep effects (spin940.spl, spwi004.spl, spwi213.spl, spwi411.spl, spwm187.spl)</li>
    <li>'Bypass mirror image' flags were set on a number of opcodes that don't support it (spin673.spl, spin940.spl, spwi004.spl, spwi016.spl, spwi213.spl, spwi502.spl, spwm187.spl)</li>
    <li>Spells which use improved invisibility will no longer set normal invisibility as it's redundant (spwi405.spl, spwi505.spl, spwi721.spl)</li>
    <li>Several spells that used swarms of EFFs have been recoded with cleaner  implementations  (sppr707.spl, sppr707a.spl, sppr707b.spl, sppr707c.spl, sppr710.spl, sppr715.spl)</li>
    <li>At its lowest level, Mazzy's strength buff was setting the exceptional strength bonus instead of incrementing it. (spin826.spl)</li>
    <li>Removed duplicatee and/or redundant effects from many items and spells (amul17.itm, bdbeltel.spl, bdddoorx.spl, bddraggh.itm, bddrggra.itm, bddrggry.itm, bdforcew.spl, bdleat05.itm, bdmisc05.itm, bdneoimm.itm, bdring09.itm, bdringge.itm, bdringgh.itm, bdsper1a.spl, bdspirim.itm, bdspnaim.itm, bdtelwe.spl, bdwyv03.itm, bhaalhp1.itm, bhaalimm.itm, chalcy3.itm, clck04.itm, dragring.itm, gorchr.itm, imoenhp1.itm, ipsion.itm, jwsuper.itm, minhp1.itm, ohtmps2d.spl, ohtmps2e.spl, potn21.itm, potn23.itm, potn25.itm, potn32.itm, potn33.itm, potn40.itm, potn45.itm, potn46.itm, ref1.itm, ring09.itm, ring94.itm, ring95.itm, ring99.itm, scrl07.itm, scrl09.itm, scrl10.itm, scrl11.itm, scrl12.itm, scrl13.itm, scrl18.itm, scrlpet.itm, sengua04.itm, spcl121.spl, spcl144.spl, spcl152.spl, spcl321.spl, spcl542a.spl, spcl611.spl, spcl612.spl, spcl613.spl, spcl632.spl, spcl633.spl, spcl634.spl, spcl643.spl, spcl644.spl, spcl722.spl, spdr301.spl, spdwd02.spl, spin117.spl, spin122.spl, spin123.spl, spin124.spl, spin710.spl, spin714.spl, spin823.spl, spin852.spl, spin920.spl, spin952.spl, sppr111.spl, sppr319.spl, sppr508.spl,  sppr517.spl, sppr613.spl, sppr701.spl, sppr704.spl, sppr717.spl, sppr717a.spl, spra302.spl, sprngb03.itm, sprngb04.itm, sprngl03.itm, sprngl04.itm, sprngs01.itm, sprngs02.itm, sprngs03.itm, sprngs04.itm, sprngz05.itm, spwi002.spl, spwi101.spl, spwi222.spl, spwi308.spl,  spwi311.spl, spwi318.spl, spwi491.spl, spwi511.spl, spwi522.spl, spwi618.spl, spwi701.spl, spwi705.spl, spwi723.spl,  spwi902.spl, spwi997.spl, surehp1.itm, trollimm.itm, wand19.itm)</li>
    <li>The duplicate, unused, and misspelled EigthNearestEnemyOfType and EigthNearestMyGroupOfType objects are removed. (object.ids)</li>
    <li> Kit check in splprot.2da is useless since it's a bitwise check, which only works for kits (e.g. mages) which happen to be  powers-of-two. It's changed to be a straight numerical check. (splprot.2da) </li>
